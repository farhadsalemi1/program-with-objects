        <p>
          HTML and CSS are both Languages.
          HTML controls the structure of a web page.

          In HTML every area of the page we are making, belongs to a box. so the whole page can be divided into multiple boxes.
          We define these boxes with the &#60div&#62  tag.
          We use class=attribute to give the boxes different styles.

        CSS: Cascading Styling Sheet
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          CSS is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements.<br>
          "Cascading" means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' child elements. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect.<br>
          There are two ways to include CSS Styling in a web page:<br>
          1: write CSS in the "head" of your HTML<br>
          2: Link your HTML to a separate CSS file<br>

        Avoiding Repetition
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The main advantage of CSS is avoiding repetition. Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.When programmers don't avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't diligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.

      <div class="concept-title">
        Inheritance
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Inheritance is a key feature in CSS, it relies on the ancestor-descendant relationship to operate. Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also to its descendants. Inheritance relies on the document tree, which is the hierarchy of HTML elements in a page based on nesting. Descendant elements may inherit CSS property values from any ancestor element enclosing them. In general, descendant elements inherit text-related properties, but box-related properties are not inherited. Properties that can be inherited are color, font, letter-spacing, line-height, list-style, text-align, text-indent, text-transform, visibility, white-space and word-spacing. Properties that cannot be inherited are background, border, display, float and clear, height and width, margin, min- and max-height and -width, outline, overflow, padding, position, text-decoration, vertical-align and z-index.<br>
          Inheritance prevents certain properties from being declared over and over again in a style sheet, allowing the software developers to write less CSS. It enhances faster-loading of web pages by users and enables the clients to save money on bandwidth and development costs.

        Selector Concept
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Perhaps the biggest key to understanding CSS is understanding selectors. Selectors are what allows you to target specific HTML elements and apply style to them. We define Selectors in CSS. The Sectors can be defined in one of the following ways:<br>
          ID Selector,<br>
          Class Selector,<br>
          Tag Selector,<br>
          Attribute Selector,<br>

        Code Comments
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Comments are lines of text that the computer ignores. They are just there so that programmers can leave concept for other people (or themselves) to read.<br>
          In HTML, code comments begin with &#60!-- and end with --&#62. Everything in between is ignored.<br>
          In CSS, code comments begin with /* and end with */.

        Box Positioning
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.
          Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.

        Abstraction
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        In programming, Abstraction is a technique for managing complexity of codes. It works by establishing a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current level. The programmer works with an idealized interface (usually well defined) and can add additional levels of functionality from other modules that would otherwise be too complex to handle. For example, a programmer writing code that involves numerical operations may not be interested in the way numbers are represented in the underlying hardware (e.g. whether they're 16 bit or 32 bit integers), and where those details have been suppressed. It can be said that they were abstracted away, leaving simply numbers with which the programmer can work. By using different layers of complexity that have been created to abstract away the functioning details, programming layout is much more manageable.
        In Python, using the existing functions from Python Standard library is an example of abstraction.

        Modules and import statement in Python
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        Module allows you to logically organize your Python code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use. A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference.
        Simply, a module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables. A module can also include runnable code.
        You can use any Python source file as a module by executing an import statement in some other Python source file.
        When the interpreter encounters an import statement, it imports the module if the module is present in the search path. A search path is a list of directories that the interpreter searches before importing a module. 
        A module is loaded only once, regardless of the number of times it is imported. This prevents the module execution from happening over and over again if multiple imports occur.
        Python ‘s from statement lets you import specific attributes from a module into the current name space.
        Module Webbrowser has useful functions dealing with Internet websites.
        Module Time has useful functions dealing with time.
        Module OS has useful functions for handling file systems.
        Urllib is a module dealing with getting information from the Internet.

        Python Standard Library

      <div class="concept-description">
        Distributed with every copy of Python, the Standard Library contains hundreds of modules that provide tools for interacting with the operating system, interpreter, and Internet. All of them tested and ready to be used to jump-start the development of any applications.
        Pythons standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities. The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs.
        The Python installers for Windows platform usually include the entire standard library and often also include many additional components.

        Class and Instance
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        A class in Python is a building blueprint that just contains structure – it defines how something should be laid out or structured, but doesnt actually fill in the content. Classes give us the ability to create more complicated data structures that contain arbitrary content. 
        The class is a fundamental building block, it is a logical grouping of data and functions (method). A class can contain any data, and can have any functions.
        In order to use class, we have to create an object or instance of this class.
        An instance is a specific copy of the class that does contain all of the content. For example, Lets say that the government has a particular tax form that it requires everybody to fill out. Everybody has to fill out the same type of form, but the content that people put into the form differs from person to person. A class is like the form: it specifies what content should exist. Your copy of the form with your specific information is like an instance of the class: it specifies what the content actually is.
        When we create an instance of a class, we are actually calling a function which is defined in the class by the name of __init__ (Constructor). This function then will create an space in the PC memory for this instance. So Classes do not occupy any space in the memory, the instances are the one which get some space in memory. 
        in the class definition we can have both variables and methods (functions).
        Turtle is a class in Python Standard Library which we use for drawing geometric shapes an move the cursor.

        The first argument of every class method, including __init__, is always a reference to the current instance of the class. By convention, this argument is always named self. In the __init__ method, self refers to the newly created object; in other class methods, it refers to the instance whose method was called. Although you need to specify self explicitly when defining the method, you do not specify it when calling the method; Python will add it for you automatically.

        Predefined Attributes
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        There a few class variables predefined for all classes in python. Here are some of these variables:
        1. __doc__  Python documentation strings (or docstrings) provide a convenient way of associating documentation with Python modules, functions, classes, and methods. An objects docsting is defined by including a string constant as the first statement in the objects definition.
        2. __name__  This predefined attribute contains the name of the class as a string.
        3. __module__ Module name in which the class is defined in string format. This attribute is __main__ in interactive mode.

        Inheritance
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        Inheritance in the subject of Object Oriented Programming means we can transfer the characteristics of a base class to other classes that are derived from it. The base class is called parent class and the derived class is called child class. Inheritance will save us from repeating codes in similar classes. We can reuse the codes written in the parent class inside child class. A child class also inherits the functions written in the parent class. However a child class can override a method that it has inherited from a parent class (Method Overriding).
